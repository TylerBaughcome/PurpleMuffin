### Purple Muffin
Purple Muffin is a chrome extension that finds arbitrage opportunities between two sportsbook event pages for the same sports event. As of now, the betrivers is the only one complete. The comparing functionality is complete, and, therefore, implementations for the other platforms are all that is necessary to complete the project. The sportsbooks included here are BetMGM, DraftKings, and Betrivers (NY). IF you attempt to run the chrome extension currently, a popup will appear, but the content will be blank due to the lack of implementations for the other platforms.
